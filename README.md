## Overview

Provide a brief introduction to your project. Describe its purpose, goals, and the problem it aims to solve. Mention the significance of generating physical models in a simulated environment and how it can benefit various applications.

## Features

List the key features of your project:

- Simple physical models (e.g., free fall, pendulum motion) implemented and simulated.
- Increasing complexity in the physical models to explore advanced concepts (e.g., projectile motion, fluid dynamics).
- Customizable parameters for the models to allow users to experiment with different scenarios.
- Visualization of simulation results for better understanding.

## Demo

Include a link to a live demo or a video demonstration of your project (if available). This can help users quickly understand what your project does and how it works.

## Installation

Provide step-by-step instructions on how to install and set up your project. Include any prerequisites and dependencies required to run your simulations.

```bash
# Example installation instructions for a Python project
pip install my_physical_model_simulator
```

## Usage

Explain how users can use your project to generate and simulate physical models. Include code examples or usage scenarios to guide users through the process.

```python
# Example code for generating a simple physical model
from physical_model_simulator import FreeFallSimulator

# Create a FreeFallSimulator object
simulator = FreeFallSimulator()

# Set parameters (e.g., initial height, time step)
simulator.set_parameters(height=10.0, time_step=0.01)

# Run the simulation
simulator.run()

# Visualize the results
simulator.plot()
```

## Contributing

Explain how others can contribute to your project. Include guidelines for submitting bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests. Also, mention any coding standards or style guides you follow.

## License

Specify the license under which you are releasing your project. Choose an appropriate open-source license that suits your needs.

## Acknowledgments

Show appreciation to any individuals, projects, or resources that have inspired or helped your project. Mention any libraries or tools you used that deserve credit.
